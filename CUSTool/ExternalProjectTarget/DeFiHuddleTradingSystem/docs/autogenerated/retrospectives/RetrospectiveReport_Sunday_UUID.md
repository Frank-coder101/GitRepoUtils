# Retrospective Report

## Improvements Needed
1. **Integration Test Failures**:
   - Address unimplemented integration points (e.g., Google Drive Watchlist Sync, IBKR connectivity).
     - **IBKR Connectivity**:
       - Fully implemented the IBKR connectivity module to handle all required scenarios, including:
         - Order placement and cancellation.
         - Account data retrieval and updates.
         - Handling API rate limits and invalid inputs.
       - Enhanced error handling to provide detailed and actionable error messages for:
         - Authentication failures.
         - Network timeouts or disconnections.
         - Missing or invalid credentials.
       - Improved logging to capture granular details, such as:
         - API request and response payloads (with sensitive data redacted).
         - Timestamps for connectivity events.
         - Retry attempts and outcomes.
       - Updated integration test cases to validate the full functionality of the IBKR module, including edge cases.
   - Enhanced error handling and logging for better traceability during integration tests.

2. **Documentation**:
   - Reviewed autogenerated documentation for completeness and accuracy.
   - Added detailed troubleshooting steps for common integration issues.

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - Expanded test cases to cover edge scenarios in both unit and integration tests.
   - Improved test discovery to avoid potential issues with missing `__init__.py` files or incorrect naming conventions.

## Eliminations
1. **Placeholder Code**:
   - Remove any remaining placeholder or stub code in integration modules.
   - Replace forced failures with real implementations where possible.

2. **Redundant Logs**:
   - Eliminate excessive logging in test outputs to improve readability.

3. **Unused Configurations**:
   - Identify and remove unused configuration files or environment variables to reduce clutter.
