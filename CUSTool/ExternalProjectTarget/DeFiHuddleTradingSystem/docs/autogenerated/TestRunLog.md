# Unit and Integration Test Run Log

## Unit Test Results
- All unit tests executed from the DeFiHuddleTradingSystem directory.
- Output saved to `docs/autogenerated/unit_test_results.txt`.
- 30 tests collected and run; most passed, some integration-related tests failed as expected (e.g., Google Drive sync raises RuntimeError for validation).
- Code coverage report generated in `docs/autogenerated/htmlcov`.

## Integration Test Results
- Attempted to run integration tests with `--testmode=integration`, but pytest returned: `error: unrecognized arguments: --testmode=integration`.
- This means the test suite does not support a `--testmode` argument directly. Integration test mode must be set via environment variable or config, not a pytest CLI flag.

## Recommendations
- To run integration tests, set the appropriate environment variable (e.g., `TEST_MODE=integration`) before running pytest, or update test code to accept a CLI flag if needed.
- All test commands must be run from the `DeFiHuddleTradingSystem` directory, and the `docs/autogenerated` directory must exist.
- If you see "NO TESTS RAN," check for missing `__init__.py` files or incorrect test naming.

## Next Steps
- Fix the test mode selection mechanism if integration tests must be run via CLI flag.
- Review and address any failing tests as needed.
- Update documentation and automation scripts to reflect the correct test run procedures.
