# Replace all mock code Prompt

## Context
- The project is a cross-platform trading system with robust integration and unit testing.
- All stubbed or placeholder code for integrations (Google Drive, OpenAI, etc.) should be replaced with real implementations.
- The current `bootstrap.py` only handles environment setup, sys.path, and loggingâ€”no stubbed code is present there.
- Stubbed code for Google Drive and OpenAI integrations is likely in `src/integration/gdrive_watchlist_sync.py` and any OpenAI-related files.
- The user may want to implement real Google Drive API and OpenAI API logic in their respective modules.

## Instructions
- Identify all locations in the codebase where stubbed, placeholder, or forced-failure code exists for integrations (e.g., Google Drive, OpenAI).
- Replace these stubs with real integration logic using the appropriate APIs and error handling.
- Ensure all integration tests are updated to validate real connectivity and fail gracefully if credentials or services are unavailable.
- Do not modify `bootstrap.py` for this purpose, as it contains no stubbed integration logic.
- If unsure which integration to address, clarify with the user or implement both Google Drive and OpenAI integrations.

## Pending Actions
- Implement real Google Drive API integration in `gdrive_watchlist_sync.py`.
- Implement real OpenAI API integration (if a relevant file exists).
- Enhance or add integration tests for these services as needed.
