# Advanced Requirement Criteria: Completeness and Quality Gaps

This file contains only the advanced requirement quality criteria not already fully addressed in the main process instructions. Use these as additional required checks for every requirement.

---

## 1. Unambiguity
- Every requirement must be stated with only one possible interpretation, avoiding vague terms and ambiguity.

## 2. Consistency
- Requirements must not conflict with each other or with known facts.

## 3. Feasibility
- Each requirement must be realistically implementable within technical, time, and budget constraints.

## 4. Stakeholder Understanding
- Stakeholders must agree on the meaning and intent of each requirement.

## 5. Additional Indicators for Readiness
- Every requirement should include, as applicable:
  - Business rules, acceptance criteria, and performance expectations
  - Clear definition of inputs, outputs, trigger events, and processing logic
  - Specification of user roles, permissions, and access
  - Wireframes or mockups for UI-related requirements
  - Data elements, format, and source/destination for data-impacting requirements
