# Test Loop Automation for Integration Tests

## Overview
This document describes an alternative approach for running all integration tests automatically in a loop, capturing all error details, and avoiding the need for manual approval of each test run in environments like VS Code.

## Why Automate Test Loops?
- VS Code and Copilot require user approval for each terminal command for security reasons.
- Automating test runs via a script allows for unattended, repeatable, and comprehensive integration testing.
- All error details and stack traces can be captured in a single log file for later review.

## Example: PowerShell Script
```powershell
$env:TEST_MODE='integration'
python -m unittest discover -s DeFiHuddleTradingSystem/tests | Tee-Object -FilePath integration_test_results.log
```
- This command runs all tests in integration mode and saves all output (including errors) to `integration_test_results.log`.

## Example: Loop Over Each Test File
```powershell
$env:TEST_MODE='integration'
$testFiles = Get-ChildItem DeFiHuddleTradingSystem/tests/test_*.py
foreach ($file in $testFiles) {
    Write-Host "Running $($file.Name)"
    python -m unittest $file.FullName | Tee-Object -FilePath integration_test_results.log -Append
}
```
- This script runs each test file individually and appends the output to the log file.

## Benefits
- No need to click "Continue" for each test.
- All errors and stack traces are captured for review.
- Can be adapted for Linux/macOS with bash scripting.

## Next Steps
- Implement this script when you want fully automated integration test runs.
- Review the log file after each run to see which tests failed and why.
