Review the requirements and enhance the full project architecture and technology stack described in the `Interactive Brokers Tech Brief.md` file. An architecture overview is not needed, we need the full details for all 3 domains (application, data and technology) and we need all the usual views (Components, Sequence Diagrams, Entity Relationship Diagrams, etc). And ensure that every artifact described in the new brief version is correctly numbered and named.

Update the brief file and also create a new file "Requirements Traceability Matrix" in CSV format that will track for each requirement numer in the requirement file (and brief requirement description), what are the associated architecture artifacts that are to be created to fullfil the requirements. Include the number of the artifact and a brief artifact name and  description. Furthermore, if an architecture artifact number fullfils more than 1 requirement, ensure there is a row in the matrix for each requirement it fullfils and that those are all associated with its artifact number and short description
