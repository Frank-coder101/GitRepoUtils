Made changes.

Log rotation is now enabled for production-grade logging (5MB per file, 3 backups). This prevents log bloat and ensures audit logs remain manageable.

Next, I will continue refining user experience, error handling, and documentation to further enhance production readiness. If you have a specific refinement or feature in mind, let me know; otherwise, I will proceed with these improvements.
