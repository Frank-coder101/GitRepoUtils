# CLARIFICATIONS
The file `Architecture_Document.md` referenced in the prompt does not exist in the workspace. I will use `Interactive Brokers Tech Brief.md` and the Requirements Traceability Matrix as the primary architecture sources.
All required API keys, credentials, and access tokens for Interactive Brokers and Google Drive will be provided by the user during configuration or setup.
The initial implementation will focus on terminal-based (CLI) configuration and UI, as GUI is optional for the first release.
The OpenAI API key for AI optimizer functionality will be provided by the user and stored securely in the configuration.
All deferred features (options, crypto, futures, full remote trading) will be stubbed with clear documentation and not implemented in the first release.
The SQLite database will be used for all persistence needs, including configuration, logs, watchlists, and backtest data.
The application will be developed in Python 3.11, as specified in the tech brief.
The user will have Python, pip, and required system dependencies installed prior to running the installer/setup script.
The application will be structured according to the Requirements Traceability Matrix, with each artifact implemented as a separate module/class.
All error codes and logging formats will follow the conventions outlined in the requirements and architecture documents.

## Code Structure Overview
- `src/` contains all core modules, data adapters, integration, and UI logic.
- Each module maps to an artifact/component in the architecture tables above.
- Tests for each module are in `tests/` and follow the same naming convention.

## Extending the System
- To add new assets, create a new module in `src/` and update the relevant manager/engine.
- To add new strategies, extend the Analysis or Backtest Engine.
- For new integrations (brokers, data), add adapters in `src/integration/` or `src/data/`.

## Testing & CI/CD
- All tests are in `tests/` and can be run with `python -m unittest discover -s tests`.
- CI/CD should run all tests and lint checks on push.

## API Documentation
- Main entry points: `main.py`, CLI wizard, and config files.
- Each module and class is documented with docstrings.
- See `/docs/Project_Requirements.md` for requirement-to-code mapping.
