# Copilot Project CRITICAL Instructions
- Never modify docs/DevelopmentProcess_Instructions.md

- Never attempt to use venv

- Always report to the user conflicting directives before starting work and request prevailing clarification for current prompt, how long should it prevail, and where a permanent change should be applied if desired

- Follow the iterative process and logic described in docs/prompts/DevelopmentProcess_Instructions.md for all AI-driven code, architecture, and test generation.

1. When user input is ambiguous or missing, estimate the best course of action, document the assumption in docs/AssumptionsLog.md, and proceed without waiting for user input.
2. Avoid false negative test anti-patterns: ensure tests fail on unexpected success, and always log both failures and unexpected passes.
3. When running PowerShell scripts, prefer using the -ExecutionPolicy Bypass flag to avoid execution policy errors, unless the user requests otherwise.
4. When automating test runs, always log full output and filter unresolved code defects into a separate log file.
5. If a script or process may conflict with another running program, check for resource, file, and environment variable conflicts before proceeding.
6. Use hardcoded absolute paths for reliability in automation scripts, but document the need to update them if the project is moved.
7. When in doubt, document all assumptions and actions in docs/AssumptionsLog.md for traceability.
