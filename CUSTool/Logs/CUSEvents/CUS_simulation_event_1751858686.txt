Key Technical Wins:

1. i@ Solved File Locking: Eliminated dependency on locked log
files

2. © Visual Monitoring: CUS “sees” the screen like a human user
would

3. @ Text Recognition: Tesseract OCR accurately reads console
text

4, i Real Input Simulation: Genuine keyboard events sent to
target application

5. [& Adaptive Response: Detects changes and responds
immediately

© ExtP shows menu — CUS detects “Select an option:" + CUS types
"4" + Enter + ExtP receives input

© This cycle repeats automatically for any configured triggers

© No manual intervention required

* Works with any console application

Congratulations! You now have a fully functional, robust CLI
automation system that can simulate user input in response to
any text patterns displayed on screen. ¢>
