6. @ Real Keyboard Input: The action was sent to ExtP in real-
time

The complete automation is now working! CUS is:

© Taking screenshots every 3 seconds

© Using Tesseract OCR to read text from the screen
* Detecting when ExtP shows “Select an option:"

* Automatically typing “4” and pressing Enter

* Continuing to monitor for more prompts

This is a fully functional CLI automation system that can respond to
any menu prompts or text pattems you configure in the simulation
ionary.

Let me wait a moment to see if CUS detects and responds to the next
prompt from ExtP:

Run command in terminal
timeout 10

Wait to see if CUS detects and responds to the next ExtP prompt
