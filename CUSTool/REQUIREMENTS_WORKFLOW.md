# ExtP Requirements Analysis Workflow

## Overview
This workflow generates requirements validation rules for CUS (CLI User Simulator) using GitHub Copilot analysis of ExtP (External Program) systems.

## Files Generated
- `generate_extp_requirements.py` - Main generator script
- `extp_analysis_prompt_optimized.txt` - Standardized prompt for Copilot
- `prompt_metadata.json` - Context metadata for reference

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Generate Analysis Prompt
```bash
python generate_extp_requirements.py ExternalProjectTarget\DeFiHuddleTradingSystem --requirements-file ExternalProjectTarget\DeFiHuddleTradingSystem\docs\Project_Requirements.md --exclude-patterns tests/ UserSimulator/ __pycache__/ retrospectives/ --llm gpt-4-1106-preview
```

**Optional parameters:**
- `--requirements-file "path/to/requirements.md"` - Specific requirements document
- `--requirements-folder "path/to/requirements/"` - Folder with requirements docs
- `--output-metadata "metadata.json"` - Save context metadata

### 2. Copy Prompt to GitHub Copilot Chat
1. Open the generated `analysis_prompt.txt` file
2. Copy the entire content
3. Paste into GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code
4. Wait for Copilot to generate the three JSON files

### 3. Save Generated JSON Files
Copilot will generate three files. Save them as:
- `requirements.json` - Application requirements and workflows
- `validation_rules.json` - Screen progression and error classification
- `test_scenarios.json` - Comprehensive test scenarios

### 4. Update CUS to Use Requirements
Modify CUS.py to load and validate against the generated requirements:

```python
# At startup
requirements = load_json("requirements.json")
validation_rules = load_json("validation_rules.json")
test_scenarios = load_json("test_scenarios.json")

# In main monitoring loop
def validate_screen_progression(current_screen, action, next_screen):
    expected = validation_rules["screen_progressions"].get(current_screen, {}).get(action)
    if expected and next_screen != expected["expected_to_screen"]:
        return "CRITICAL: Workflow progression failure"
    return "SUCCESS"
```

#### Implementation Note: Requirements-Driven Validation and Defect Prompt Integration

After integrating the requirements, validation rules, and test scenarios as described above, the CUS system now performs requirements-driven validation of workflow progression in the main monitoring loop. Specifically:

- After each simulated action, CUS compares the screen content before and after the action (using OCR) to determine the actual transition.
- The function `validate_screen_progression(current_screen, action, next_screen)` is called with the before/after screen content and the action performed. This checks the transition against the loaded validation rules.
- If a workflow progression failure is detected (i.e., the transition does not match the requirements), this is now included in the error context passed to the `IssuePromptGenerator`.
- The defect prompt generated for the failure (saved in `UserSimulator/DefectPrompts`) is augmented with details about the requirements-driven validation failure, including the expected and actual screens, the action, and the specific rule violated.
- No separate output is created for requirements validation failures; instead, the existing defect prompt/reporting system is made more accurate and requirements-aware.

This ensures that all workflow progression failures are traceable to requirements and validation rules, and that defect prompts provide actionable, requirements-driven feedback for remediation.

## Expected Output Structure

### requirements.json
- Application metadata and description
- Expected workflows with triggers and responses
- Screen definitions and available actions
- Critical requirements that must be validated

### validation_rules.json
- Screen progression rules (A + action â†’ B)
- Error classification (CRITICAL/WARNING/INFO)
- Timeout settings for various operations
- Success/failure criteria for each progression

### test_scenarios.json
- Step-by-step test scenarios
- Priority levels (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Success and failure criteria
- Expected screen progressions

## Key Benefits

### Requirements-Driven Validation
- Validates against intended behavior, not just code behavior
- Distinguishes critical workflow failures from implementation details
- Ensures ExtP meets user requirements

### Screen-by-Screen Progression
- Defines expected state transitions
- Detects when ExtP gets stuck or loops incorrectly
- Validates that actions produce expected results

### Error Classification
- **CRITICAL**: Requirements violations, workflow failures
- **WARNING**: Code behavior mismatches, timing issues  
- **INFO**: Normal operations, successful fallbacks

## Troubleshooting

### Prompt Too Large
If the generated prompt exceeds safe limits:
1. Check file sizes in the ExtP directory
2. Move large files out of the main directory temporarily
3. Use `--requirements-file` instead of auto-discovery
4. Reduce the number of auto-discovered files

### Missing Context
If Copilot needs more context:
1. Add specific requirements files with `--requirements-file`
2. Ensure main.py and key CLI files are in the ExtP directory
3. Check that README.md contains workflow descriptions

### Generated JSON Issues
If Copilot generates incomplete JSON:
1. Ask Copilot to regenerate specific sections
2. Validate JSON syntax before saving
3. Add missing fields based on the expected structure

## Example Usage

```bash
# Basic analysis
python generate_extp_requirements.py "C:\Projects\MyExtP"

# With specific requirements
python generate_extp_requirements.py "C:\Projects\MyExtP" \
  --requirements-file "C:\Projects\MyExtP\docs\requirements.md" \
  --output-prompt "my_analysis.txt"

# With requirements folder
python generate_extp_requirements.py "C:\Projects\MyExtP" \
  --requirements-folder "C:\Projects\MyExtP\specifications" \
  --output-prompt "comprehensive_analysis.txt"
```

## Integration with CUS

Once you have the three JSON files:

1. **Place files in CUS directory** - Same folder as CUS.py
2. **Modify CUS startup** - Load requirements at initialization
3. **Enhance validation logic** - Check progressions against rules
4. **Update error reporting** - Use new classification system
5. **Run enhanced tests** - Validate requirements compliance

This workflow transforms CUS from a simple input simulator into a comprehensive requirements validation system.

# Comprehensive ExtP Analysis: Configuration & State Management
