Install Python 3.11+\n2. Clone this repository\n3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n4. Run the application: `python main.py`\n\n## Usage\n- On first launch, follow the CLI wizard to configure your account and preferences.\n- Select BackTesting or Live mode as needed.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n- Check the audit log at `~/.defihuddle_audit.log` for errors.\n- Ensure your Interactive Brokers credentials are correct.\n- For support, see the documentation in `/docs`.\n\n## Running Tests\n- All tests are environment-agnostic. To run all tests:\n\n  ```sh\n  python -m unittest discover -s DeFiHuddleTradingSystem/tests\n  ```\n- The test suite automatically ensures the `src` directory is on `sys.path` for all test runs.\n\n## Integration Testing with Interactive Brokers (IBKR)\n\nTo run integration tests or live trading, you must have TWS or IB Gateway running and accessible. Set up your broker config as follows:\n\n```\n\"broker\": {\n    \"type\": \"TWS\",           # or \"IBG\" for IB Gateway\n    \"host\": \"127.0.0.1\",      # TWS/IBG host\n    \"port\": 7497,               # TWS default port (7497 for paper, 7496 for live)\n    \"clientId\": 1               # Any unique integer\n}\n```\n\nSet the environment variable `TEST_MODE=integration` to enable real API calls:\n\n- On Windows PowerShell:\n  ```powershell\n  $env:TEST_MODE='integration'; python -m unittest discover -s DeFiHuddleTradingSystem/tests\n  ```\n- On Linux/macOS:\n  ```bash\n  TEST_MODE=integration python -m unittest discover -s DeFiHuddleTradingSystem/tests\n  ```\n\nIf TWS/IB Gateway is not running or the config is incorrect, integration tests will fail with a clear error message.\n\n## Quickstart Example\n1. Launch the CLI wizard: `python main.py`\n2. Follow prompts to configure your account and preferences.\n3. Select BackTesting or Live mode.\n4. Review audit logs at `~/.defihuddle_audit.log` for activity and errors.\n\n## Glossary of Key Terms\n- **BackTesting**: Simulated trading using historical data.\n- **Live Trading**: Real trades with Interactive Brokers.\n- **Audit Log**: Centralized log of all trading activity and errors.\n- **Watchlist**: Persistent list of symbols to monitor/trade.\n- **Configurable**: Any setting or logic the user can change via UI or config file.\n\n## Configuration & Customization\n- All major settings are accessible via the CLI wizard or config files in `/config`.\n- See `/docs/Project_Requirements.md` for a list of all configurable items.\n\n## Error Handling\n- Errors are logged in the audit log and displayed in plain language.\n- For troubleshooting, see `/docs/DevelopmentProcessAssumptionsLog.md` and `/docs/Architecture_Document.md`.\n"

2.4\n- Ambiguity: Original requirement 2.4 did not specify what \"in scope\" means for features or how to handle future asset classes.\n- Resolution: Clarified as initial support for stocks, extensibility for other asset classes, and documentation of deferred requirements (2.4.1\u20132.4.4).\n- Assumption: \"Multi-asset coverage\" means the architecture must be extensible beyond stocks.\n- All changes traceable to original 2.4.\n\n## Entry: Requirement 2.5\n- Ambiguity: Original requirement 2.5 was a notation/convention, not a functional requirement, and did not specify how key concepts are tracked or referenced.\n- Resolution: Clarified as a process requirement for glossary, traceability, and mapping of key concepts (2.5.1\u20132.5.3).\n- Assumption: The use of `...` is a formal convention for marking key concepts.\n- All changes traceable to original 2.5.\n\n## Entry: Requirement 2.6\n- Ambiguity: Original requirement 2.6 was a notation/convention, not a functional requirement, and did not specify how configurability is implemented or documented.\n- Resolution: Clarified as a process requirement for user interfaces, documentation, and validation of all

requirement 5.2 was vague about the confirmation process, liability language, and auditability.\n- Resolution: Clarified as requiring explicit, logged user confirmation with liability release, persistent UI indicator, and re-confirmation on restart.\n- Assumption: \"Accepts all liabilities and frees author\" means a formal, logged acknowledgment is required before live mode is enabled.\n- Assumption: User identity is available for logging; if not, session ID or device ID will be used.\n- All changes traceable to original 5.2.\n\n## Entry: Requirement 5.3\n- Ambiguity: Original requirement 5.3 was broad and did not specify boundaries for auto-tuning, logging, or user control.\n- Resolution: Clarified as detailed requirements for training log structure, auto-tuning scope and safeguards, learning/enhancement cycles, and user management of enhancements.\n- Assumption: Only settings explicitly marked as auto-tunable may be changed by the AI; all critical/risk settings are protected.\n- Assumption: All logs must be both human- and machine-readable.\n- Assumption: User approval is required for all code changes unless explicitly configured otherwise.\n- All changes traceable to original 5.3.\n\n## Entry: Requirements 17\u201324\n- Ambiguity: Original requirements were concise but lacked explicit detail on logging, user notification, and configuration boundaries.\n- Resolution: Clarified as explicit, testable requirements for polling, alerting, user controls, state persistence, and data formats.\n- Assumption: All polling intervals, thresholds, and criteria are user-configurable unless otherwise stated.\n- Assumption: All logs and alerts must be both human- and machine-readable where applicable.\n- Assumption: Emergency stop and symbol deactivation must persist across restarts unless explicitly cleared by the user.\n- All changes traceable to original requirements 17\u201324.\n"

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Focus on REQUIREMENTS-DRIVEN validation, not code-driven behavior
2. Define clear screen progression expectations
3. Identify what constitutes workflow progression failure vs. normal operation
4. Create specific, measurable validation criteria
5. Classify all possible error types appropriately
6. Ensure test scenarios cover critical user workflows
7. Make all timeouts and expectations realistic for production use

Based on the ExtP analysis context provided above, please generate these three JSON files with comprehensive, production-ready requirements validation rules.
