Prompt for REQ-001: CUS shall correctly respond to ExtP configuration menu prompts

Review all code in ExtP that handles configuration menu prompts. For each place where the code does not:
- Detect all possible configuration menu prompts
- Correctly map prompts to the expected CUS response
- Handle edge cases (unexpected menu text, missing options)
- Log the detected prompt and the simulated response

Please update the code to ensure full requirements coverage. Add tests if missing.
