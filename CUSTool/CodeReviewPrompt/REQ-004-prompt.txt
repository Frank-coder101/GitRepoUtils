Prompt for REQ-004: CUS shall provide accurate feedback when ExtP configuration is incomplete

Review all code in ExtP that provides feedback or error messages for configuration. For each place where the code does not:
- Detect incomplete configuration states
- Provide clear, actionable feedback to the user
- Log the incomplete state and the feedback given
- Trigger the correct CUS response

Update the code to ensure this requirement is met and add tests if missing.
