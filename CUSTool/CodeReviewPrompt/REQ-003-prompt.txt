Prompt for REQ-003: CUS shall differentiate between configuration success and configuration bypass

Review all code in ExtP that handles configuration completion. For each place where the code does not:
- Clearly distinguish between a successful configuration and a bypass (skipped, failed, or incomplete)
- Log the outcome and reason
- Trigger the correct CUS response for each case

Update the code to ensure this logic is explicit and add tests if missing.
