Prompt for REQ-002: CUS shall detect when ExtP shows 'already configured' message

Review all code in ExtP that processes or displays configuration status. For each place where the code does not:
- Detect the 'already configured' message reliably
- Distinguish between initial configuration and already-configured states
- Trigger the correct CUS response for this message
- Log the detection and response

Update the code to meet this requirement and add tests if missing.
