}

ANALYSIS PURPOSE:
Generate comprehensive requirements validation rules for CUS (CLI User Simulator) to validate ExtP (External Program) behavior against requirements rather than just code implementation.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:
The generated rules must distinguish between:
- CRITICAL: Requirements violations and workflow progression failures
- WARNING: Code behavior mismatches and implementation issues
- INFO: Technical details and successful operations
